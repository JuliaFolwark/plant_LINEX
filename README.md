# pLINEX: Lipid Network Explorer for Plants

## Abstract
This repository contains the implementation of the Lipid Network Explorer for plants (pLINEX), a bioinformatics tool developed to analyze stress responses in *Arabidopsis thaliana* by extending the existing Lipid Network Explorer (LINEX), originally designed for animals. Lipids are critical in plant metabolism, including maintaining cell structure, signaling, and responding to environmental stress. As climate change presents increasing challenges to agriculture, understanding plant lipidomes is essential for improving crop resilience. The primary objective of this research was to develop pLINEX, a plant-specific extension of LINEX, and to test it using lipidomics data from *A. thaliana* under heat stress and fungal infection conditions. While pLINEX successfully constructed plant-specific lipid networks, it did not identify significant changes in the lipidome under the various stress conditions, raising questions about the tool's effectiveness or the quality of the input data.

## Project Overview
pLINEX is a bioinformatics tool designed to analyze lipidomic data specific to plants. It extends the functionality of the original LINEX tool to accommodate the unique lipid structures and metabolic pathways found in plants. This tool was developed with a focus on *Arabidopsis thaliana*, a model organism in plant biology, and was tested using lipidomics data from experiments involving heat stress and fungal infection.

### Key Features
- **Plant-Specific Lipid Network Construction**: pLINEX parses and curates data from the Plant Metabolic Network (PMN) and Rhea databases to build a plant-specific lipid network.
- **Stress Response Analysis**: The tool was developed to analyze changes in lipid composition and metabolism in various plant species under different stress conditions.
- **Customizable Data Input**: Users can input their lipidomics data, choose
